			<h5>Hello, my name is Adam Klemm and I am an experienced web developer in the great city of Chicago.</h5>
			<img src="images/amk_profile.jpg" alt="" />
			<p>
				I have an expert level Html / Css skillset as well as experience with Javascript frameworks such as Backbone, Angular and React.
				I also have experience with PHP and Wordpress having built out custom themes utilizing barebones templates as well as modifying existing themes.
				My primary focus over the past few years has mainly been on html css and javascript.
				If you are looking for someone who can quickly turn out html/css code from Photoshop or Sketch documents with javascript functionality and the ability to integrate into Back-End languages, I feel that I would be a great contribution.
